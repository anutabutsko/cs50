            <td>"True Detective"</td>
            <td>It was very realistically filmed with a very surreal situation. "Real Detectives" don't usually deal
                with serial killers -- especially of that magnitude of psychosis. But it put very believable characters
                in that unworldly situation, over a very long span of time.

            <td>"Breaking Bad"</td>
            <td>Breaking Bad is amazingly engaging and is one of the few shows that makes you feel like you are the
                characters. When it ends, you will want to re-watch it for the rest of your life.
            </td>

        <tr>
            <td>"Game of Thrones"</td>
            <td>Game of Thrones is the most decorated screen adapted series in history. It has the most nominations, the
                most awards and the most media attention. Game of Thrones is arguably one of the smartest, most nuanced
                shows around, in both plot and language.

        <tr>
            <td>"The Office"</td>
            <td>There are many comedies, but The Office's mockumentary-style makes it feel like your invested in these
                people's lives and you can see yourself, your friends, your co-workers, and maybe even your boss in
                these characters.
