sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: This method is a lot slower than sort2 and very similar in time to sort3. However, if we run sorted50000.txt,
time elapsed = 0m0.425s, comparing to time ./sort3 sorted50000.txt = 0m3.130s. Which proves that sort1 uses
Bubble Sort method and gets licky with omega rotation(n).

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: This Method is noticebly faster than the other two with one exceprion of lossing to Bubble Sort with already
sorted files.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: This method is slower than sort2  and faster than sort1 when ran through all the files. However, it loses to sort1
with sorted50000.txt, because, unlike bubble sort, omega rotation of selection sort is equal to big O rotation of selection sort.
Thus it takes the same amount of time to sort sorted or unsorted list, while bubble sort is noticeably faster
(explained in sort1 answer)
time ./sort3 sorted50000.txt = 0m3.130s comparing to time ./sort1 sorted50000.txt = 0m0.425s
